# Introduction

The male pattern baldness (MPB) has been a major concern in the global community. The demand for new products and treatments has increased a lot.  The MPB is the most common way to lose hair amosng men at age of 20-30 and it increased 10% per decade (Liu, F., Hamer, M. A., Heilmann, S., Herold, C., Moebus, S., Hofman, A., Uitterlinden, A. G., Noethen, M. M., van Duijn, C. M., Nijsten, T. E. C., & Kayser, M. (n.d.)) Thus, scientists and researchers are using an advanced statistical approach to analyze and examine the relationship between hair growth on men of different MPB treatments over their ages. This study helps to find which treatment can be more effective for which group of male population which are more or less bald. This paper concludes that luxuriant treatment is more efficient than placebo treatment for MPB. However, this study finds no relation between age and hair growth values in any treatment.
