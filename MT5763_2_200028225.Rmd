## Abstract

## Introduction
add purpose of your investigation 

## Analysis Description -
#### clear account of what you did statistically as well as the data
#### wrangling,) and why

created the copy of existing dataset
there was no null values in dataset. havet needed to removed any row or columns
not needed to change the name of columns. 

DATA WRAGLING:
COPIED EXISTING DATA TO DATA SET TO AVOID MUNIPLATION ON ORIGINAL DATASET
TRANSFORMING WIDE DATA TO LONG DATA - created 4 dataset and combined them
convered hair growth values inches to mm.



## Results
#### add visualization 
#### are the results clearly explained and presented (includes data visualization):
Draw table of mean and different values to answers each of queation.
NUMERICA SUMMARY TO CHECK MEAN , AND OTHER VALUES.
HISTOGRAM OF AGE VARIABLE TO SEE IN WHICH AGE PPL ARE DOING WHICH TRAETAREMENT MORE.
frequency table to check data set has which age highest data based on age
summary of new data set 

## Further research - 

## Conclusion
